### Introduction 

Energy comsumption remains a major concern for poperty managers and utility companies that supplies the energy!

As worries about climate change and environmental sustainability rise, it is critical for businesses, particularly those in the retail sector, to understand and effectively manage their energy consumption. Shopping malls, with their enormous lighting, heating, cooling, and other electrical systems, provide a good chance for an in-depth examination.

In our Helsinki Shopping Mall Properties Energy Consumption Data Analysis project! We investigate and analyze the energy usage patterns of various retail malls in Helsinki ,Finland, in a bid to gather important insights into energy consumption, identify relationships between the consumption and location, weather, and time. We believe this would contribute to sustainable practices in the power generation and  commercial real estate industry.

This repository provides data collected via an API from [__avoindata.fi__](https://helsinki-openapi.nuuka.cloud/swagger/index.html#/EnergyData) over a specified period(data from 2015 was indicated as reliable) spanning many aspects of energy use in Helsinki's retail malls. The data was collected using API request functions , which allowed us to collate comprehensive details on energy usage across various mall assets.


### Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:

**Identify Consumption Patterns:** Through detailed examination of the energy consumption data, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and fluctuations in energy usage over time.

**Benchmarking and Comparison:** By comparing the energy efficiency of different shopping malls, we can identify best practices and areas where improvements can be made.

**Energy Saving Opportunities:** Our analysis will uncover potential energy-saving opportunities and provide recommendations for optimizing energy usage without compromising visitor comfort and safety.

**Hypothesis testing:**: 

**Data-Driven Decision Making:** We believe that data-driven insights are crucial for making informed decisions, and this analysis aims to provide valuable information to mall owners, managers, and stakeholders.

### Repository structure 

For ease of navigation, we have organized the repository as follows:

/data: This directory contains the raw energy consumption data collected from various shopping malls in Helsinki.

/notebooks: Here, you can find Jupyter notebooks detailing the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling process.

/reports: This directory holds the final reports, visualizations, and any additional documentation related to the analysis.

/helper: this folder will include the source code for functions used for data collection via API.
