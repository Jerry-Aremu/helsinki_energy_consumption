### Introduction 

Energy comsumption remains a major concern for poperty managers and utility companies that supplies the energy!

As worries about climate change and environmental sustainability rise, it is critical for businesses, particularly those in the retail sector, to understand and effectively manage their energy consumption. Shopping malls, with their enormous lighting, heating, cooling, and other electrical systems, provide a good chance for an in-depth examination.

In our Helsinki Shopping Mall Properties Energy Consumption Data Analysis project! We investigate and analyze the energy usage patterns of various retail malls in Helsinki ,Finland, in a bid to gather important insights into energy consumption, identify relationships between the consumption and location, waether, and time. We believe this would contribute to sustainable practices in the power generation and  commercial real estate industry.
